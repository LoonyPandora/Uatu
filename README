Log viewing pages have a nick filter, done in JS

No pagination on logs, it's only text so small enough amounts of data
Pagination is well annoying in chat logs.
Traffic is low enough that it won't be an issue

There is no dialog tag, and thus marking up conversations using description lists
is not encouraged. So use an ordered list, closest analogue. Rob the style I used for VR:

<ol>
    <li class=":nick :timestamp" name=":unique_id">
        <time datetime=":datetime">:time</time>
        <cite class="nick :nick">:nick</cite> <!-- HTML5 Recommend against this, but spec will likely change -->
        <p class="message">:message</p>
    </li>
</ol>
